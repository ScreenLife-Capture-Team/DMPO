## File folder for MacOS users
This is a temporary file folder for users interested in running the DMPO on Macbooks. To get DMPO working with MacOS, rename "macosmain.js" - found in this folder - to "main.js" and replace the "main.js" file in the root folder of the DMPO. This is a temporary fix. Do also remember to specify the javaPath in the "default-settings.json" file to point directly at the Java executable.
